        <p><b>Every four years, the federal government is required to gather up the leading research on how climate change is affecting Americans, boil it all down, and then publish a National Climate Assessment. This report, a collaboration between more than a dozen federal agencies and a wide array of academic researchers, takes stock of just how severe global warming has become and meticulously breaks down its effects by geography — 10 distinct regions in total, encompassing all of the country’s states and territories.

          The last report, which the Trump administration tried to bury when it came out in 2018, was the most dire since the first assessment was published in 2000. Until now.
          
          The Fifth National Climate Assessment, released on Tuesday by the Biden administration, is unique for its focus on the present. Like previous versions, it looks at how rising temperatures will change the United States in decades to come, but it also makes clear that the rising seas, major hurricanes, and other disastrous consequences of climate change predicted in prior reports have begun to arrive. The effects are felt in every region. In the 1980s, the country saw a billion-dollar disaster every four months on average. Now, there’s one billion-dollar disaster every three weeks, according to the assessment. All of the many extreme weather events that hit the U.S., from the tiniest flood to the biggest hurricane, cost around $150 billion every year — and that’s likely a huge underestimate. 
          
          “Climate change is here,” said Arati Prabhakar, director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Biden administration during a briefing on the report. “Whether it’s wildfires or floods or drought, whether it’s extreme heat or storms, we know that climate change has made its way into our lives and it’s unfolding as predicted.”  
          
          The report outlines steps every level of government can take to combat the climate crisis. And it takes stock of the progress that has been made over the past four years. There’s good news on that front: President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress have managed to pass historic climate measures that are expected to reduce the country’s carbon footprint between 32 and 51 percent by 2035, putting the U.S. closer to meeting its emissions targets under the global climate treaty known as the Paris Agreement. A number of cities and states have passed climate policies that can serve as a blueprint for what actions the rest of the country, and indeed the world at large, needs to take in the coming years. California’s clean car program and the Northeast’s regional carbon cap-and-trade program are two examples</p>

            <p>Report Background: Every four years, the federal government is mandated to compile and publish the National Climate Assessment. This report summarizes the leading research on how climate change is affecting Americans and involves collaboration between various federal agencies and academic researchers.

              Unique Focus on the Present: Unlike previous assessments that primarily looked at future impacts, the Fifth National Climate Assessment emphasizes the present effects of climate change in the United States. It highlights that the predicted consequences, such as rising seas, major hurricanes, and other disasters, have already begun to occur.
              
              Increase in Climate Disasters: The report notes a significant increase in the frequency and severity of climate-related disasters. In the 1980s, the U.S. experienced a billion-dollar disaster approximately every four months. However, currently, there is a billion-dollar disaster occurring every three weeks on average.
              
              Financial Impact: The economic impact of extreme weather events is substantial, estimated at around $150 billion annually. This figure is considered a conservative estimate.
              
              Quote from White House Official: Arati Prabhakar, the director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy in the Biden administration, emphasizes that climate change is already affecting people's lives and unfolding as predicted. The mention of wildfires, floods, drought, extreme heat, and storms illustrates the diverse impacts.
              
              Government Steps and Progress: The report outlines steps that governments at all levels can take to address the climate crisis. It also acknowledges progress made over the past four years, including historic climate measures passed by President Joe Biden and Democrats in Congress. These measures are expected to reduce the country's carbon footprint significantly.
              
              Global Climate Treaty: The passage mentions that the U.S. is closer to meeting its emissions targets under the Paris Agreement due to the climate measures implemented by President Biden and Democrats in Congress.
              
              Local Initiatives: The report recognizes the efforts of cities and states, citing examples like California's clean car program and the Northeast's regional carbon cap-and-trade program. These initiatives are seen as potential blueprints for broader actions that need to be taken globally in the coming years.</p>
